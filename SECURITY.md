# Security Policy

Please note that this bot is **not** intended to host any private information.
You should not supply any information to the bot that you would not want as public as
an unlisted web link, such as an "accessible by anyone with the link" google sheet.
This is mostly because the bot is currently a one-maintainer job, and I am not a security expert,
so I cannot guarantee information will be kept private. If you would like to improve the 
privacy of data stored by this bot, please submit a pull request or feature request,
not a vulnerability report.

## Supported Versions

The latest tagged version will always be the only supported version of this bot.
If you are self-hosting, please make sure the bot version you are using is fully
up-to-date before submitting vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the code, please report it under the "Security" tab
ONLY until you hear back from a maintainer. If you do not hear back within a week,
you may submit an issue at your own discretion to warn other users. Also feel free
to create a private fork for a pull request if you believe you have a solution to the
vulnerability.

Please provide as much of the following information as you have:
- The circumstances required for the vulnerability to be exploited
- Possible fixes for the vulnerability
- Any dependencies that cause or are associated with the vulnerability

Thanks for helping keep our code safe to use!
